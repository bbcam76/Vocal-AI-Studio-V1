The file path you provided, `/vocal-mood-studio/vocal-mood-studio/backend`, seems to be incorrect as it does not specify a file name. The `backend` directory should contain files related to the Node/Flask API. 

Please specify a file name within the `backend` directory, such as `app.js` for a Node application or `app.py` for a Flask application, so I can generate the appropriate contents for you.
